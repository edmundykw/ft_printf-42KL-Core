# 42KL Core Porgram - ft_printf
## About
This is the second project within 42KL's core program. The main goal is to learn *variadic function* by recreating a simplified version of `libc`'s `print` function.
### Mandatory
The printf function that I recode should handle for `diuxXcsp%` type conversions.

### Bonus

1. Manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and the field minimum width
under all conversions.
2. Manage all the following flags: ’# +’ (Yes, one of them is a space)

  My printf did not include the bonus portion.
